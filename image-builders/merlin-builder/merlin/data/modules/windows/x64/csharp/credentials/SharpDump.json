The MiniDumpWriteDump Win32 API call is used to create a minidump for the process ID specified (LSASS by default) to C:\\Windows\\Temp\\debug.out, GZipStream is used to compress the dump to C:\\Windows\\Temp\\debug.bin (.gz format), and the original minidump file is deleted.\r\n\t-SharpDump will dump the memory from LSASS if a ProcessID is not provided",
