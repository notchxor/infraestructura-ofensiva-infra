Merlin is a post-exploit Command & Control (C2) tool, also known as a Remote Access Tool (RAT), that communicates using the HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 protocols. HTTP/3 is the combination of HTTP/2 over the Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol. This tool was the result of my work evaluating HTTP/2 in a paper titled `Practical Approach to Detecting and Preventing Web Application Attacks over HTTP/2 <https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/protocols/practical-approach-detecting-preventing-web-application-attacks-http-2-36877/>`_. Merlin is also my first attempts at learning `Golang <https://golang.org/>`_.

.. important::
    This tool is intended to only be used during research and authorized testing.
